Currently I am playing with some disk images, and having to revert them rather more regularly than I would like. I was finding it a bit annoying waiting for cp commands to complete. As an alternative, there is rsync

{% highlight bash %}
rsync -ah --progress source dest
{% endhighlight %}

Also, when sync is slow, some progress on that would be good

{% highlight bash %}
watch grep -e Dirty: -e Writeback: /proc/meminfo
{% endhighlight %}
